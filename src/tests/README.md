# Testing in this Project

## Current Status
This project currently includes test files as demonstrations of what tests should validate, but doesn't have the full testing setup configured.

## How to Set Up Testing
To properly implement testing in this project, you would need to:

1. Install testing dependencies:
   ```
   npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/user-event @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/react-hooks
   ```

2. Install TypeScript types for testing:
   ```
   npm install --save-dev @types/jest
   ```

3. Configure Jest in a jest.config.js file:
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     preset: 'ts-jest',
     testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
     setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/src/tests/setupTests.ts'],
     moduleNameMapper: {
       '^@/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/src/$1'
     },
     transform: {
       '^.+\\.tsx?$': 'ts-jest'
     }
   };
   ```

4. Create a setupTests.ts file:
   ```typescript
   import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
   ```

5. Add the following to package.json:
   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "test": "jest"
     }
   }
   ```

6. Update tsconfig.json to include test files and jest types.

## Test Files
The current test files demonstrate the kind of tests that should be written:

- **ServiceForm.test.tsx**: Tests for the ServiceForm component
- **ServiceList.test.tsx**: Tests for the ServiceList component
- **useServiceManagement.test.tsx**: Tests for the useServiceManagement hook

These files are currently set up as React components with console logs to show what would be tested when a proper testing environment is configured.
