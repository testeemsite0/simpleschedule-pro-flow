# Testing Setup Instructions

To complete the testing setup, add the following script to your `package.json` file:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "vitest run",
  "test:watch": "vitest"
}
```

After adding these scripts, you can run the tests using:

```bash
npm run test
```

or watch mode:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```
